amiicli.sh Deprecation Notice
=============================

Due to the introduction of the new HTTP-based API, the documentation related to the old, shitty and hacked-up protocol have been removed from this repository.

Old service will cease to work on ~~01/March/2016~~ 14/January/2016, due to ISP changing IP, rendering old scripts with hard-coded address obsolete.
